# fonebridge2

*Original Redfone foneBRIDGE2 setup utilities
*These are the original files and setup utilities downloaded from the old Redfone Support website.

*The .sh script still points to the older website to download the files and needs to be udpated to skip that process
if checking out this project using GIT.

*The fonulator RPM file may or may not work on different Centos/Redhat variants.
